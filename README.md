# Joblisting Webapp

This is an application made for myself as I try to improve my Python, JavaScript, TypeScript skills along with Django and React.

It is a job listing app where employers can list jobs and applicants can apply to them.


## Goals:

By the end of this project I want to have a better understanding of React and deepen my knowledge in Python and JavaScript.


## What you can expect to find in this application:

* A full authentication system for applicants, employers and administrators with their own unique roles.

* Job listing creation for employers.

* Application submission for applicants looking for jobs.

* Notification system.
